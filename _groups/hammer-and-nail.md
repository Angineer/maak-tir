Officially, The League of the Hammer and Nail. A two-tiered democracy with a 3-member governing board.

A hierarchical mercenary group. New members are "nails" and there is competition to become a "hammer," where members get guaranteed employment and the promise of induction into the closeknit fellowship.

A protected class that protects their membership with muscle. Vested members get additional benefits:
- Voting rights
- Shareholder in league's business profits
