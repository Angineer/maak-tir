<p>The Katars are a shadowy group of assassins, named after the unique type of blade that they are known to use on their targets. Although the group is based in the southern parts of the continent, they have been seen operating in all parts of the empire.</p>

<p>The group is loosely knit and small bands of Katars will typically take on contracts without approval from any authority in the organization. The tie that binds them is a religion focused on asceticism and developing skill with their signature blade, which they consider holy. There are only a handful of craftspeople that make the blades, and members of the group must pass a rigorous test before they are allowed to carry one (to carry a blade without passing the test is considered a sin).</p>
