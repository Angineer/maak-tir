The Order of Heironeous is a group of holy warriors. Their temple is on the slopes of the Mountain of the Ancients. The Order will accept trainees from all walks of life and all races. Upon joining the Order, all members give up their surnames.
The Oath of Heironeous

All trainees, in order to become members of the Order, must take the following oath:
>I will treat all creatures with dignity, as they are vessels for His holy work\
>I will keep my mind free of earthly considerations, as it guides my flesh\
>I will commit my soul only to Him, as He keeps my mind pure\
>I will remember my own mortality, as my soul is the tie that binds me to Him\
>I will eradicate evil from the world, no matter the cost, as this is His will

Generally, the oath is interpreted in the following way:
* Do not eat meat (although fish are usually not considered to be meat)
* Do not consume alcohol
* Remain celibate
* Rest and fast once per month
