The Six Stars are an egalitarian organization of monks that serve The Temple Six, the theocratic authority in Sod.

They worship six semi-neutral gods in congress and the Temple has survived so long in part because of its unobtrusiveness and adaptability.

The Six Star pantheon consists of:
* Obad-Hai- God of nature
* Boccob - God of Magic
* Pelor - God of the Sun
* Nerull- God of Death
* St. Cuthbert- God of Common Sense and Discipline
* Olidammara- Goddess of Trickery and Revelry

Monks dress in simple blue robes and bear the medallion of a six-pointed star around their necks after the completion of their initiation. They may devote their lives to a single god, or not specialize and serve the "Temple Entire".
