The first and most important aspect of fighting is staying alive. If you are an adventurer and you intend to continue drawing breath, then you are in good company; this tome endeavors to work toward that end by sharing the knowledge and skills of a fighter whose adventures substantiate his expertise in this matter, as evidenced by the continual movement of his pen upon this page.
Weapons

In many ways, a fighter is like a farmer. A farmer must work when the opportunity arises: there is no recompense for sloth, only the harsh retribution of a paltry winter. He toils at his craft under an unforgiving sun or a threatening storm cloud. Likewise, a fighter must accept that there is no substitute for constant vigilance. When a beast lays its hands upon you, your survival will be measured by the hours that you spent honing your craft.

Despite the necessity of heed, the learned farmer will recognize that careful selection of the appropriate tool will eliminate unnecessary struggle. Removal of a pigweed is better suited to the hoe than the scythe; while a scythe may eliminate the visible threat quickly, the offender will unmistakably return from the remaining roots, leaving the farmer to perform a job twice that should have been finished in one attempt. Likewise, a fighter may find that using a nearby stool or dinner plate to defend themselves reduces their load when traveling on the highway, but the foe will likely take comfort knowing that such an attack does little to endanger their mortality.

Fighters should choose their weapon carefully. The method of decision is not as important as the commitment that undergirds it. Once a weapon is chosen, the path for the fighter is laid out, as the road through a dangerous land. Treading on the path will carry you to the far side in the shortest time and with the fewest risks; wavering will present unnecessary danger. This is not to say that a fighter must select the first weapon he or she hefts. It is common for trainees to scrutinize many different weapons until the most appropriate for the fighter's demeanor is selected.

Once a bond is created between wielder and wielded, fighters should treat their weapon with respect, as a friend that stands by their side in time of need. In doing so, they should also strive to understand their friend's abilities, weaknesses, and ambitions. Only the deepest of relationships between fighter and armament, forged through contemplation and demonstration, will be certain to protect each other's life in time of need.
The Intellect and the Ego

As is readily evident by now, there are many considerations for the burgeoning fighter. However, the very nature of such considerations should also be subject to the scrutiny of a successful warrior.
