Smittyville is a trading hub on the imperial road, just south of the capitol. It connects the mountains in the west, the capital region in the north, the sea in the east, and the lesser desert in the south. Smittyville is the seat of the Merchants Guild and, as a result, is constantly buzzing with merchant activity.

Smittyville is well fortified and has an exceptional guard, headed up by Glenn. It is surrounded by a large stockade wall. Smittyville is divided into quarters, each of which identified by their position on a compass:
- The Northwest Quarter is the location of the granaries and the headquarters for the Guard
- The Northeast Quarter is home to the Merchants Guild and the Burning Pitch
- The Southeast Quarter is the location of the livestock pen
- The Southwest Quarter is mostly residential

The daily newspaper is the Merchandiser. The median house price is 1500 GP. Average rent is 50 GP/month.
