The Kalelani Tribe holds political control over most of Montrosia. Membership in this confederacy requires tithe of money and resources, but provides stability in an otherwise chaotic region of the world. Kalelani are famous for their drovers trained in Helmhold, the ostensive capital of the tribe. Fearsome disciplined allosaurus mounts of the Kalelani quiet most thoughts of aggression against protected villages. Its not just war that the value of Kalelani animal handling can offer its vassals. Stone mover team and units dedicated to road building and wall making help improve the lives of anyone flying the purple banner of the Southern King. As the source of their power, dinosaurs enjoy a deep respect in their culture.



Titus Guyver

Still in his thirties, he is known for his brash attitude and promiscuity. Despite this he is a savvy politician and a capable fighter. He is also a controversial figure for his propensity for favoring diplomatic relations. Many Kalelani view the extra tithes this entails and the outside influence as dangerous precedent. This habit is best exemplified by the marriage of his daughter to a Prince of the Empire. Views of the most traditional Kalelani have shifted recently, as older allies like the Red Wings are seen as responsible for cattle theft and murder at the Great Dinosaur Race Massacre. Simultaneously, the ostracized Lizardfolk came to the Kalelani's aid at the event and continue to in its aftermath.


Keira Guyver

Keira is Titus' treasured counselor, especially for her forgiveness and permissiveness regarding Titus' marital transgressions. Her social savvy and reputation for brutal reprisals helps her maintain respect from all Kalelani. 


Mira Guyver

Daughter of Titus and Keira. Mira’s marriage to Prince Fortenboss has caused some friction among the more xenophopic of the Kalelani. Her sterling military reputation has lent legitimacy to relations with the empire.


Ashra Guyver

Daughter of Titus and Keira. Ashra is a strong nationalist and disdains her sister's union with Imperial royalty and has taken up the cause of Kalelani exceptionalism. 


Eaton Wex

Commander of Montrosia’s Rangers loved by all Kalelani. He exhibits the typical characteristics of a Ranger: Spartan, proud and quick to anger. Wex is special in that he is a lot smarter and more proactive than his predecessors. It was he that orchestrated the consolidation of No‐Eyes’ forces. This allowed the commander to broker peace with the Orc Chieftain, a rare but controversial feat. Despite these moves and unlike Titus, opinion of Eaton Wex is close to unanimous approval. He has made his name at a young age as one of the finest Rangers ever to have lived. Armies many time larger break under his strategy and word has spread far of the many great beasts he has slain.

Little is know of his wife who is cloistered at home with their infant son Paz.
