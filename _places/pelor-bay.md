Pelor Bay is the main port in Maak-Tir. As such, it is a very active city with many different kinds of people passing through. It is also the home of the Temple of Pelor, which acts as an arm of the empire, through which the rulers keep an eye on the city.

The city is fairly urbane and friendly to magic, in contrast to the capital, where persecution of powerful magic users is not uncommon.

Pelor Bay used to be called Crescent Bay in pre-empire days after the shape of the bay.
