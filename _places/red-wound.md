Amongst the Dark Scars, the Red Wound is s fortress built into the cliff-sides from the vast fortune accrued by the mercenary nation known as the Red Wings. While most Meloi live in all pocketed tribes, this warrior culture stands out from their fellows. The singular fixation on war has even become a commodity sold far across the continent. The vast herds and flocks that surround this headquarters come from animals gathered far and wide, even including cattle. Some Meloi disparagingly call them ‘milkdrinkers’. Though to say this within earshot of a Red Wing is to invite a brutal death.

Massad IV

Feared throughout Maak‐Tir, Massad I raised the Red‐Wings from a band of dino rustlers to an expansive mercenary company. Though no longer in the business of stealing animals for more a hundred years, other Meloi still hold this against the group. From a geo-political perspective they are not only the most significant Meloi trib, but their far-flung influence exceeds even that of the Kalelani King. Massad IV is most known for expanding the group into the farthest northern reaches of the continent. Her feats have been made achievable by the fanatical discipline and loyalty she inspires. Her abilities in combat are legendary. Unlike most Meloi she resides in permanent location.
