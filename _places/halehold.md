Halehold is a small farming village. Its location on the coast makes it a key shipping location for local farmers moving their goods to other parts of the empire.

The village was founded by a halfling named Istestous Hale and his friend Nimorzan. Nimorzan was a wizard that used his powers to help build the village. He also built his home in a stone castle just outside the village walls.

About a year ago, Nimorzan started losing touch with reality and spending more and more time holed up in his tower. One night, a large electrical storm destroyed a large part of the city wall. Nimorzan hasn't been seen since then. Despite multiple incursions by adventurers, no one has entered the tower and returned.
