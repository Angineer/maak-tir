South Tomton and North Tomton produce a large chunk of the capitalâ€™s goods. North Tomton specializes in clay and coal, which are mined on opposite sides of the city.

The city is built of honest Union bricks throughout, and they're damn proud of it.

Lots of bath houses. The miners traditionally go there to clean off after a long day in the mines.

The Union Building is an iconic building.

The Coal Mines

Dirtier but just as important

Non-human races enjoy more freedom and respect in North Tomton than other places in the Empire. Here, the value of a person is based on their work ethic more than their lineage. There is thriving dwarf miner community.
Noodleball

North Tomton has a thriving Noodleball obsession. There are multiple leagues throughout the city. The city is also bitter rivals with their neighbors South Tomton; most favor the North and see the South as an underdog.
The Company Store

The company store is open 24/10/360. Workers can spend their chits there. Others are welcome, but don't get the discount provided by the Union.
Conflict

The Union is always battling the Merchants Guild on the political stage. Merchants aren't outlawed in North Tomton, but they face more hostility here than in the Capital. The MG tries to undercut North Tomton prices using their cheap goods imported via the Black Talon Trading Company.

Nearby, one can find One-Shot Village. Think Majula from Dark Souls 2. The more people you save and the more things you do, the more populated it gets.

Folks from North Tomton just think of it as a deserted ghost town.
