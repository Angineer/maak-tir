An-Tir is a mountain stronghold. Built many years ago by skilled masons, it has withstood conflicts innumerable. Perhaps because of its security, it is the location of some of the oldest knowledge in the empire and learned persons come from far and wide to study there.

An-Tir has a tenuous relationship with the empire. Although technically under imperial control, it is run by a locally-organized military organization, the Grey Warriors. They maintain the city's defenses and run the government functions with ceremonial representation from the empire in their ranks.

## History

An-Tir has long been a source of fabric from the llamas that live in the mountain regions. There is also a long-running marble quarry not too far from town that supplies marble to buyers all over the continent. Imperial soldiers like to go to the quarry after work, get drunk, and throw rocks into the quarry pools.
