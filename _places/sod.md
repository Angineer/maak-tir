When traveling south on the imperial road, Sod is the last town before reaching the Lesser Desert. Known as “dirt town” to capitol citizens, Sod is considered a backwater town, mired in filth and corruption. Although a closer look will reveal that it is little different from other similarly-sized cities, it is built on a layer of soil that is not found anywhere else in Maak-Tir, leading some to speculate that that is the origin of its nickname.
