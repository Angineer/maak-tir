Giants Foot is a peak in the Maak mountain range. It is also the location of a village of frost giants. Some humans travel there occasionally, but it is too dangerous for most to even bother visiting. Because of the peak's altitude, snow persists there year-round and the terrain is extremely inhospitable.

There is a portal deep under the mountain that allows travel to other places in the plane. It is hidden in a labyrinthine network of tunnels that only a few people in the entire continent know how to navigate.
