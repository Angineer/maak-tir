Areestond is famous for its ice palace. Every year, as the cold winter approaches, the city builds a new one. People travel from far away to marvel at its beauty and participate in the Ice Palace Festival. Then, in the warmer months, the palace slowly melts away. Many families in the North imitate this tradition on a much smaller scale, building ice palaces near their home.

The Ice Palace represents the constant change and sharply contrasting seasons that are a part of life in the North. It also represents the ideals of people of the North, such as ornamentation and stoicism.
