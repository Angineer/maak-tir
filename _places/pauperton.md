If Kingâ€™s Rest is where the richest citizens take their vacations, Pauperton is the equivalent for those of less-noble means. Many merchants and skilled craftsmen have taken to retiring in Pauperton at the end of their days to watch the sunrise over the ocean.

Locals don't love the partying crowd, but they know that the economic prosperity of the city depends on it.

Hammer and Nail mercenaries are also found here, similar to Kings' Rest. HQ is here. They own significant real estate in the city and often rent it out to revelers on spring break.

There is a big artist community in Pauperton.

There is a real estate developer group in Pauperton trying to "keep up with" the Kings' Rest citizens. They work hard to create investment in the city in order to compete and push a very progressive agenda. They worry about property values going down and freeloaders relying on their investments without paying taxes.
