Noblescross is a city at the intersection of the imperial road and the tranquility road (a.k.a. the hedonism highway). Because of its location between Wy-Tir and Kingsâ€™ Rest, it is a rest stop for rich travelers from the capital going to vacation on the coast. This also makes it a hotbed for cheap thrills and loose morals. Many merchants come to Noblescross to sell souvenirs.

Because most travelers turn east when they reach Noblescross, all points south are considered uncivilized to the upper classes of Maak-Tir.
