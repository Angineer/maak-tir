Kings' Rest is a seaside destination for the empire's richer citizens. It is full of large estates and grand architecture.

Kings' Rest has a secret society, the Empyrean Crest. What are they worried about? The ocean threat: underwater caves off the coast connected to the home of the Kuo-toa. The (truly secret) higher ups are busy managing the threat of the Kuo-toa. There is a separate branch of the society that's more involved in petty criminal behavior--this is the one that most people know about. Although they are nominally part of the same group, their diametrically opposed activities can lead to a game of "secret society telephone."

They tend to swindle folks of Pauperton stemming from their sense of entitlement.

Hammer and Nail mercenaries are common in Kings' Rest because they are hired by the rich citizens as bodyguards and security guards.

The Hammer and Nail rely on citizens' fears of invasion, piracy, etc.
