Before being annexed by Maak-Tir, Vylstrong was the capitol of the Northlands. It is a rugged, self-sufficient city and the citizens there have much more loyalty to the North than they do to the Empire. It's common to hear Vylstronders joke about how they are just waiting for the Empire to run its course so the city can regain its independence. Vylstrond's citizens are hardened by snowbound isolation and this shows through in their cultural traditions.

Vylstrond is built on the slopes of Dagny Peak, an active volcano. Dagny has not had an outright eruption for thousands of years, but lava flows are not uncommon. The geothermal activity under the mountain is a source of energy for Vylstrond, which uses it to generate steam. A complex system of steam pipes run throughout the city; these pipes power many of the aspects of everyday life for Vylstrond's citzens.

Similar to many other places in the North, Vylstrond's architecture is heavily Gothic.

Niam Leeson is the governor.
