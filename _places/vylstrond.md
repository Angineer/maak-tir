Before being annexed by Maak-Tir, Vylstrong was the capitol of the Northlands. It is a rugged, self-sufficient city and the citizens there have much more loyalty to the North than they do to the Empire. A classic joke in Vylstrond says the only reason they sell food to the imperial soldiers is so that they can retreat faster when the city eventually regains its independence.
