Oasis is a small settlement in the Lesser Desert that is a trading post for merchants and artisans. It is settled around a spring-fed oasis that sustains the local population and herders that frequently stop by.

The desert people are relatively quiet and tend to keep to themselves, although they have to be fierce in order to survive the harsh climate. They also tend to spend their time introspectively, which is probably how Oasis came to be a gathering place for artists.

Everyone in Oasis knows Shan-to, a regional warlord who rules over the wastes. Although he wields his power with a heavy hand, the desert people respect him because he has protected the desert from external attacks, including northern raiders trying to seize power in Oasis as well as lizard folk who tend to encroach from the Riverlands in the south.
