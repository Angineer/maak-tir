South Tomton and North Tomton produce a large chunk of the capitalâ€™s goods. North Tomton specializes in clay and coal, which are mined on opposite sides of the city.

The city is built of honest Union bricks throughout, and they're damn proud of it. The Union is always battling the Merchants Guild on the political stage. Merchants aren't outlawed in North Tomton, but they face more hostility here than in the Capital.

Non-human races enjoy more freedom and respect in North Tomton than other places in the Empire. Here, the value of a person is based on their work ethic more than their lineage. There is thriving dwarf miner community.
