## Poetry of Maak-Tir
### Impromptu 

<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">First attempt,
Got cold feet,
Double guessed,
â€œTurn, retreat!"

Second try,
Thought it through.
Better results
Than impromptu
</div>

### A Hunter's Poem

<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Run fast, run, hare; the day is young.
The passing dew in the morning sun
may be the last meal you eat
'fore I catch and cook your meat.
</div>
