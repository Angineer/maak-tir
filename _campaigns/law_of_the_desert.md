Shan-to

    Lives in the waste

    Takes girls for his brothel

    Townspeople are unhappy but it is the desert law

History

Shan-to
Shan-to's Encampment

Over the crest of the next dune, you see the landscape changes from sand to stone. Not too far away, among the craggy outcroppings is a canyon. From your vantage point, you can see a short section of the canyon and you notice that it is filled with a handful of colorful but wind-worn tents. There also seems to be some sort of water source there, as the canyon has shrubs and small trees growing along it.

The encampment stretches some distance up the canyon. Along the distance, some of the women are living in tents, while others are living in natural crevices cut into the rock by erosion.
