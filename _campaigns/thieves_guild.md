The Merchants Guild has never taken kindly to halflings, assuming that they are always causing trouble or conspiring to do so. They have gone so far as to require the guard in Smittyville to search all halflings that pass through the city. What the casual citizen doesn't know, however, is that reports of theft and missing goods are on the rise...

There are many hints that could tip off an adventurer to the presence of the guild:

    An given halfling in the city has a 5% chance of being involved in the guild and will have a tattoo on the bottom of their foot in the shape of the guild symbol

    Gabriel Bakhuizen is an accomplice and collects a 100 GP/week tax for allowing them to pass through the entrance built into his house

There is a hidden entrance to the Thieves Guild on the roof of Gabriel Bakhuizen's house. It has a combination lock with the combination:

    Jug, Rat, Candle, Rat

The lock can be smashed with DC 25 (strength), but it will automatically jam and the door will cannot be opened after that. There is an emergency exit via a tunnel that opens into the basement of the general store. It has to be smashed (DC 20) but is very hard to find from the general store side (DC 35) because it just looks like a foundation. There is an alarm in the guild that sounds inside the house. If the guild is compromised, the members will sound the alarm, then light the entire place on fire to destroy the evidence of their work.

Inside the guild, adventurers will find a sizable collection of stolen goods:

    3d100 GP

    1d6 rolls of silk

    A set of mastercraft thieves tools

    1d6 weapons of various types

    1d8 pieces of armor

    1d4 barrels of high quality rum

    A pantry of foodstuffs

    Maps with locations of hidden stores across the city, locations and codes for access to the Thieves Guild in each major city, and a series of secret tunnels that are being dug under the Merchants Guild building. The information is encoded in a secret language that must be deciphered (DC 35, DC 30 for halflings).

Generally, members of the guild consider themselves a brotherhood and do not steal from each other. Violations are dealt with using the thieves' code, a copy of which can be found on a bookshelf in the guild's office. The head of the guild is Tewodros Hendrex.

The thieves' secret phrase is:

    "The sun shines brightest in moonlight"

    "But the night is coldest at dawn"
