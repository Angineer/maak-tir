Our adventurers find themselves sitting at a table at Cooper's Casket. At the table next to them, One-Eyed Pete is going on again about his lost treasure... woof.

"I tell ye, me treasure is lost beneath the sea. I'd give ye a map but I've forgotten the way. All I recall is glitter shells beneath me boots."

Polly tells you a little more about his story:

"He can't even remember to tie his own shoes most days. The pirate life was good to him in his youth and now it's taking its toll. But he's a good man so I don't mind having him around my bar.

The story goes like this: Pete used to sail with Black Robert when Robert was first coming to fame as a pirate. They made a big score and came back here to spend it, but Robert and Pete couldn't agree on how much Pete was owed for his services. So Pete had some men loyal to him take a part of the gold and hide it away.

Robert found out and beat Pete to a pulp. When Pete came to, he could remember the treasure but not where he hid it. So he's been rambling on about it for years, but no one's found it. Frankly, at this point, no one really knows what happened to it. Maybe Robert took it back, maybe Pete never really got his hands on it."

At the docks, there are some clues:

- Julien is preparing to sail out. He knows of the tale but hasn't been stopping at the island long enough to have a guess about the true outcome of the conflict.
- If pressed, Julien does know about the cycle of glitter shells and that they may have been on this very beach about 10 years back

Two entrances to the cave:

- One in the rocks at the edge of the beach. There are two columns of stones across the island, one of which has fallen down. If you stand at the Pigeon Coop and line up the columns correctly, they will point to the stone that covers the entrance.

- One in the basement of Cooper's Casket. It was an old escape route for pirates trying to get away from the law. Polly had it covered up to avoid trouble.
