Octavia and her twin sister, Josephine (“Jo”), were born into the Blackstone family near North Tomton.  Their father was a hard-working blacksmith, and their mother was a priest and community leader. As children, the twins were inseparable, sharing an almost supernatural bond. Their parents instilled a strong moral compass, and Octavia and Josephine protected each other from the hardships of youth.

However, their ethical beliefs began to diverge. Jo developed a warped understanding of her mother’s teachings and grew to believe that suffering was holy. Despite having a life filled with love, Jo felt broken, and justified her feelings by declaring them spiritual. “Suffering is strength”, she would say, and she believed it was her calling to inflict pain onto others to make them strong.

Jo made a deal with Loviatar, the goddess of pain. In exchange for driving a knife through her twin’s heart, she would be granted the power to inflict unspeakable pain and suffering onto the world. Octavia was on the brink of death, but managed to survive through her endurance.  However, her grief changed her forever.

Octavia’s heart shattered from experiencing such a betrayal from the person she trusted the most. Her gut-wrenching sobs shook the gods to their cores. Ilmater, the god of endurance, took pity and bestowed Octavia with a sacred quest. Octavia would dedicate herself to healing those who are suffering, guiding souls to their rest, and protecting the living from the horrors of treachery.

Octavia now wanders Maak-Tir, seeking to protect others from the pain she has known. She has embraced the darkness within herself, finding beauty in the macabre and a strange comfort in death. She believes that death is not something to be feared but respected, and she uses her abilities to ensure that the dead are honored and the living are protected.
