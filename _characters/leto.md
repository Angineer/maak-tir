Leto spend his youth as a military advisor in goblin extermination campaigns. After successfully serving out his conscription he applied his experience to service as a Town Guard in Smittyville. He was quickly recognized for his ability to innovate solutions and de-escalate conflicts. His soft touch was preferred by  unsavory elements of Smittyville's merchant elite, but his nosy nature and unconventional investigations also rub them the wrong way.

After a few strange adventures around town, including a mutant rat incursion,  and the killing of the town scourge Norm the Gnome, Leto began to slide from comfort in his career to existential doubt. Being a party yet to another torching of a goblin encampment, Leto set into motion his retirement as a Smittyville guard.

Leto found passage on a ship which ultimately left him shipwrecked on an unknown island where he had to contend with a brutish Orc shipmate and a town infested with werewolves.

With little explanation he woke up in Barovia, having to contend with a land even more saturated by fierce monsters and dark magic than the last.
