Norm was a disgusting waste of space. Good riddance! No, seriously--Norm was lower than the most wretched vermin. He was a gaunt, slimy piece of horseshit that never accomplished anything and only got in people’s ways. The ugly, smelly loser worked for the Smittyville Inn, but couldn’t be trusted because he was always up to no good.

Norm was killed by Farron in Smittyville.
