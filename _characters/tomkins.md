Tomkins is a rather magical gnome. He seems to appear out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly as he arrived. He also seems to know a lot about the world (is he well traveled?) and has a knack for identifying people's true intentions (does he see through their ruses?).

Tomkins really is quite a mystery, but he sure is helpful to have around every now and then.
