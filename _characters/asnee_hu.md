Asnee is a fighter looking to apply his lengthy training in the real world.

Asnee has spent decades studying the art of combat, refining his skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, his mind plays out each attack and counter before he strikes for maximum effect. Though his magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells he has chosen enhance his already prodigious ability.

Asnee is a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite his studious nature, he is aware that there are limits to practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of his deadly art. Adventuring companions are usually the type who will need a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, he has both to spare.

Asnee uses polysyllabic words that convey the impression of great erudition.
