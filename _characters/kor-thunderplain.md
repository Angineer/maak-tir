Kor Thunderplain is a Sorcerer from the plains surrounding the Dark Scars.

He is a ferocious wanderer of the untrodden ways, a survivor who constantly tests himself against the dangers of the world--and conquers.

Despite his self-sufficiency, he tires of a life alone. His clan is far, but these companions are the closest thing to a tribe. As long as they can prove themselves worthy of his company, he will travel with them.
