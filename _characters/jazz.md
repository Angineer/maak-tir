Jazz is a wondering Bard. As a child he traveled with a small troupe of performers. The troupe came across a group of bandits who killed everyone, leaving Jazz the sole survivor. Jazz has sworn a vendetta against criminals and bandits. He now doubles as a fun loving performer by day and a vigilante named Gray Hood (formally know as Arsenal) by night.... and sometimes day too. He is currently travelling with Kiagomu and Thunk, a.k.a "Team Jazz". Together they captured the pirate captain Black Robert and his crew. 

During an adventure on Pirate Roost Jazz came across Silvano Maetri, owner of  the Corsair Distillery. Jazz is attempting to get a corporate sponsorship from him. Silvano is going to pay Team Jazz's way off the island and gave them a discount on rum to spread the word. The Featherweight is the ship they are waiting for. It seems delayed, possibly because of the Pirates. 

Team Jazz, led by Gray Hood bravely took on the remainder of the pirates aboard there ship. Winning the ship and freeing Pea, a small boy from the pirates clutches Team Jazz plans to sell the ship.

Jazz, drunkenly agrees to start a chicken empire with Kiagomu. Jazz agrees to fund at lease 30 gold to try and get 4,000 chickens. There is a good chance Jazz will not remember this.
