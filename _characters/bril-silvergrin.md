Bril is a halfling rogue. He grew up in the capital with his mother, who worked for a fish-monger. Because his mother was always working, Bril grew up on the streets, where he learned to pick pockets to earn gold.

After his mother passed, Bril used his saved gold to move to Smittyville, hoping that the presence of the Merchants Guild would mean a bigger score. When he realized that Smittyville was too tightly policed for his roguish intentions, he headed further south, looking for more exotic treasures to pilfer.
