Rex Livingston began his career as an ambitious Acolyte in the Temples of Pelor Bay. his handsome charms and forthright attitude have made him many friends, but his lack of decisiveness and wayward spirit prevented ascension to higher ranks despite lifelong service since childhood. Also, the mutual separation with his first partner and mother of three children led aspersions from the clerics managing his work. 

On the cusp of outright rejection from his profession Rex met a woman that would change the circumstances of his family forever. As Rex describes her heavenly beauty one should heed that this is not hyperbole. They met as he was tending to the victims of sweating sickness spreading through the bay.  On the cusp of death Rex risked his life to fulfill three of her dying wishes. With help from his ex-wife Linda and their children, Rex completed the tasked, but Lucinda did not pass. 

And as she healed they decided to live together and eventually to get married. As a condition for the annulment of his previous marriage Rex was forced to leave the temple. Starting a new life together they continued their healing work. Although possessing some nursing knowledge, the treatments Rex and Lucinda performed were successful to the point of being considered miracles, vastly exceeding any credible expectations. 

When the children born from Lucinda started exhibiting glowing eyes, calming auras and producing light the Temple gained an interest in them both until one day a sanctified inquisitor arrived with a formal investigation into their home. Rex was subjected to three tests to measure the blessings of Pelor upon him. He passed each one. 

It was at this moment Lucinda revealed herself as the Solar Anekphoniton Aidhios Agalliasis. She passed judgement then on the Inquisition for its pride and arrogance, and decreed the disbandment of the organization. She then embraced Rex and tasked him with finding the treasure that would secure the legacy of  the temple forever. With no further information she vanished in a flash of light. 

The Temple, equally unclear about Rex's quest, yet equally invested in its success has backed the security of all his children and Linda, assuring they have all the food, shelter and support they could ever need. In return, Rex ventured out aimlessly, letting the reading of divine "signs" guide his way. 

Somewhere near the Steel River, his escort was mercilessly slaughtered by bandits. Unaccustomed to such violence, the event has left Rex very traumatized, but he wanders on, spurred by the discovery of a magical compass that materialized after a vivid dream.

Rex still prays to the sun every day, and sends individual messages of hope to Linda and all the kids. He receives visions of each one of them in his sleep, interpreting them very literally as messages from Anekphoniton Aidhios Agalliasis, a.k.a. Lucinda. Lucinda hasn't spoken directly to Rex since the disappearance. However, the celestial power manifested through his healing touch and searing bright lights from his hands and eyes serve as further signs of her presence and support.
