Buck was born in the North and lived in the small village of Pine. Buck studied masonry as a young dwarf.

In his "teenage" years, Buck met a dwarven lady, Tasgiel, and fell in love. They were married and had 3 children. They lived in Buck's hometown.

One day, after returning from a journey to Vylstrond, he found his house burnt to the ground and the remains of his family among the ashes. He was so devastated by the loss that he left society and wandered the wilderness. He left all his remaining family and friends behind.

Buck lived off the land and seldom interacted with civilization for many years. He grew hardened and learned many different ways to survive in the wild.

By accident, Buck stumbled upon a druidic circle. Sensing the bond that Buck had developed with the natural world, the druids welcomed him in and taught him the druidic ways.

From studying with the druids, Buck began to find new understanding about the balance between life and death. He realized that by running away from his trauma, he had left his wound unhealed. Eventually, he returned to his hometown. Acknowledging his pain gave Buck catharsis but also grief and regret.

Buck brings his newfound appreciation for life into his next chapter as an adventurer. He wants to face challenges without fear and prove to himself that his years of pain have made him a stronger dwarf than he once was. He also brings along many of the survival skills that he developed during his time in the wilderness. Despite reintegrating with society, Buck still talks little and doesn't give leeway for weakness.
