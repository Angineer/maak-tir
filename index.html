        <h3>Welcome to Maak-Tir</h3>
        <p>You find yourself sitting at the local tavern. Across the bar, a burly green orc eyes you as you finish off your pint of beer. The drunkard next to you attempts to regale you with a tale about goblin kings and vicious pirates. Turning to leave, you see a flash of a gold on a man's lapel as he rushes out the door on some kind of important business.</p>

        <p>Following the fishy businessman out into the street, you find yourself in the center of a small but fast-paced city. A nearby guard gives you a suspicious look. The bulletin board behind her flutters with posters seeking daring adventurers and promising large sums of gold for their services.</p>

        <p>Beyond the city's palisade walls stretches an empire that encompasses the eastern half of a lush continent. The world around you is filled with quaint towns, vibrant wilds, and bands of bright-eyed adventurers. Welcome to Maak-Tir.</p>
